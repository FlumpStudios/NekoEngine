## What the hell is this?

This is a super small 2D engine with GUI tools for making a basic FPS game based on the awesome [Anarc](https://drummyfish.gitlab.io/anarch/).
The idea is to create a simple set of tools, such as image and sound data generation and level editor, to allow people to knock up a simple retro shooter.
My main goal is to create an engine and a set of tools simple enough for my 7 year son to use.
It's super early days at the moment, so it's very light on features and probably buggy as hell. However, at the time of writing, you should be able to knock some basic levels up, as well as switch out textures and sprites.
