# Introduction

Welcome to Neko, a 3D raycasting engine and level design tools based on Drummyfish's exceptional [Anarch](https://drummyfish.gitlab.io/anarch/).

## What is it tho?

Neko started as a 3D raycasting engine based on a modified version of anarch. The goal? To create an engine and tools that are approachable enough for my 7-year-old son to start crafting levels, while maintaining the flexibility needed for my more ambitious indie game projects.

This project serves as a precusor to Neko Neo, a custom 3D engine, writtin in C and Raylib, designed to seamlessly integrate with the Neko editor tools.

## Key Components

## Key Features

- **3D Raycasting Engine**: Powered by a modified version of Drummyfish's Anarch.
- **Level Creation Tools**: Intuitive tools designed for crafting levels.
- **Asset Editing Tools**: Streamlining the process of tweaking and customizing textures and sound effects.
- **3D Level Previewing**: View your levels in full 3D powererd by Neko Neo :)	


## Getting Started

To start editing levels just run the NekoBuilder.exe, hopefully the UI is simple enough to get started.
I'll write a proper readme with instructions when I have more time.
